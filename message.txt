Bethany has been able to touch millions of people with her faith message, charitable efforts, and overall spirit. You might know her from her film soul surfer, her new documentary unstoppable, or from her many interviews including one with Oprah. In this interview, we talk about how Bethany fosters this immense belief in herself, how she handles fear, and what inspired her to keep pursuing her purpose no matter what.
